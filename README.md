--> In this project I've use the Flexbox Layout to give order to the items.

--> Notes:
1- justify-content: center; /* used for the main axis */
2- align-items: center; /* used for the cross axis */

--> Flexbox: 
-> very well explained here: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp
-> Summary:
1.- A Flexible Layout must have a parent element with the display property set to flex.
2.- display: flex; /* Flexbox Layout: The flex container becomes flexible by setting the display property to flex. */
3.- Direct child elements(s) of the flexible container automatically becomes flexible items.
